Just completed my ML ZoomCamp 2025 Midterm Project! 🎉

Built an ML system to predict mutual fund & ETF performance:
✅ 1-year return prediction (Regression)
✅ Investment quality classification 
✅ Risk rating prediction

26K+ funds analyzed | XGBoost models | Flask API + Docker

🎯 Just completed my ML ZoomCamp 2025 Midterm Project!

I built a comprehensive machine learning system for analyzing and predicting mutual fund and ETF performance. Here's what I accomplished:

**Problems Solved:**
• Regression: Predict 1-year returns using XGBoost
• Binary Classification: Classify funds as good/poor investments
• Multi-class Classification: Predict risk ratings

**Technical Highlights:**
• Analyzed 26,000+ funds with 236 features
• Implemented XGBoost models with train/validation/test splits
• Built a production-ready Flask REST API
• Containerized with Docker for easy deployment
• Comprehensive documentation and testing

**Key Results:**
The models achieved strong performance metrics across all three tasks, helping investors make data-driven decisions about fund selection.

This project demonstrates end-to-end ML engineering: from data cleaning and EDA, through model training and evaluation, to API development and containerization.
