🚀 **Just Completed My First Capstone Project: ASEAN Investment Vehicle Analysis with Deep Learning!**

I'm excited to share my latest project from the ML ZoomCamp 2025 - a comprehensive machine learning system that analyzes investment vehicles across ASEAN markets! 📊

**🎯 What I Built:**

- Deep Learning model (TensorFlow/Keras) to classify investment attractiveness
- Analyzed stocks, ETFs, and REITs across 6 ASEAN countries (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam)
- Calculated technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) and risk metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Volatility)

**🛠️ Technical Highlights:**
✅ Model conversion to ONNX for optimized inference
✅ Deployed as **Serverless (AWS Lambda)** using Docker
✅ Deployed on **Kubernetes (Kind)** with Flask API
✅ Complete CI/CD pipeline with automated data fetching and preprocessing
✅ RESTful API endpoints for real-time predictions

**📈 Tech Stack:**
Python | TensorFlow/Keras | Flask | Docker | Kubernetes | AWS Lambda | ONNX Runtime | scikit-learn | yfinance

**Key Learnings:**

- End-to-end ML pipeline development
- Model optimization and deployment strategies
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Serverless architecture patterns
- Financial data analysis and feature engineering

This project reinforced the importance of not just building models, but deploying them in production-ready environments. The ability to serve predictions via both serverless and containerized deployments provides flexibility for different use cases.

Big thanks to the ML ZoomCamp community for the amazing learning journey! 🙏

🚀 Just shipped my first ML Capstone project! Built a Deep Learning system to analyze ASEAN investment vehicles (stocks, ETFs, REITs) across 6 countries 📊

Deployed on both AWS Lambda (serverless) AND Kubernetes!

🛠️ Tech Stack:

- TensorFlow/Keras for DL model
- ONNX for optimized inference
- Flask API for serving
- Docker + K8s for orchestration
- AWS Lambda for serverless
- yfinance for market data

Full pipeline from data → training → deployment!

**Tweet 3:**
📈 The model analyzes:
✅ Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
✅ Risk metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Volatility)
✅ Historical performance patterns

Then classifies investments as "Attractive" or "Unattractive"

**Tweet 4:**
💡 Key learnings:

- Model conversion (Keras → ONNX) for faster inference
- Deploying same model to multiple platforms
- Container orchestration with Kind/K8s
- Serverless architecture patterns

Production ML is so much more than just training! 🎯
