I’m excited to share the evaluation of three mid‑term projects from #MLZoomCamp2025:

1️⃣ **Red Wine Quality Prediction** – Scored **15/18 (B+)**. Strong problem definition, model training, Docker container, but missing cloud deployment and virtual‑env docs.
2️⃣ **JAMB Score Prediction** – Scored **9/18 (50%)**. Excellent documentation & modeling; however, it lacks a standalone training script, API, containerization, and cloud deployment.
3️⃣ **Stress & Wellness Prediction** – Scored **18/20 (A)**. Outstanding across the board with FastAPI, modern dependency management, and Docker. Only cloud deployment is missing.

Overall, the projects demonstrate solid ML pipelines. The next focus should be on cloud deployment and environment reproducibility to reach production‑grade readiness. #AI #ML #DataScience #ProjectReview
