Completed Homework 6 of ML Zoomcamp 2025 - Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning! 🎯

In this assignment, I worked on building regression models to predict car fuel efficiency using various tree-based algorithms:

🔹 Trained Decision Trees and identified optimal splitting features
🔹 Built and optimized Random Forest models with hyperparameter tuning
🔹 Experimented with n_estimators (10-200) to find the sweet spot where RMSE stops improving
🔹 Grid searched max_depth parameters to minimize validation error
🔹 Analyzed feature importance to understand key predictors
🔹 Implemented XGBoost models and tuned learning rate (eta) for best performance

Key takeaway: Ensemble methods significantly outperform single decision trees, and proper hyperparameter tuning is crucial for optimal model performance.

The complete solution is available in my GitHub repository with detailed Jupyter notebook implementation.
