🚀 **Just completed Homework 9 of the ML Zoomcamp!**

This week was all about **Serverless Deep Learning**. I deployed a TensorFlow/Keras model using **AWS Lambda** and **Docker**.

Key takeaways:
✅ Converting models to **ONNX** for faster inference.
✅ Packaging the model and code into a **Docker** container.
✅ Implementing a serverless handler for **AWS Lambda**.

It's amazing to see how we can serve deep learning models in a scalable and cost-effective way without managing servers.

A huge thanks to DataTalks.Club for this amazing course!

Just crushed Homework 9 of #MLZoomcamp! 🚀

Deployed a hair type classifier model using #Serverless architecture.
🛠️ Tech stack: #AWSLambda + #Docker + #ONNX + #Python

Learned how to:
1️⃣ Optimize models with ONNX ⚡
2️⃣ Containerize with Docker 🐳
3️⃣ Deploy serverless functions ☁️

Thanks @DataTalksClub!
