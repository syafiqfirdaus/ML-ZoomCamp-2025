🎯 **Milestone Achieved: ML Model Evaluation Mastery!**

Just completed Homework 4 of the ML Zoomcamp 2025, diving deep into model evaluation metrics! 📊

**Key learnings:**
✅ ROC AUC for feature importance analysis
✅ Precision-Recall tradeoffs and curve analysis
✅ F1 Score optimization for balanced performance
✅ 5-Fold Cross-Validation for robust model assessment
✅ Hyperparameter tuning with systematic evaluation

Working with the lead scoring dataset, I implemented logistic regression models and explored how different evaluation metrics tell different stories about model performance. Understanding when to use precision vs recall vs F1 is crucial for real-world ML applications!

The journey from training models to properly evaluating them is where the magic happens. 🚀
