🚀 Just completed Homework 10 for #MLZoomcamp!

This week, we dove into Kubernetes ☸️. I deployed a lead scoring model using Kind, creating a local cluster and managing deployments and services. It's amazing to see how easily we can orchestrate containerized ML models!

Thanks to DataTalks.Club for the amazing simplified curriculum. Learning K8s is a game changer for ML deployment.

Just wrapped up HW10 for #MLZoomcamp! 🚀

Deployed a lead scoring model to a local #Kubernetes cluster using Kind. ☸️
From building the Docker image to configuring deployments & services, it was a great deep dive into K8s for ML.

Big thanks to @DataTalksClub! 🙌
