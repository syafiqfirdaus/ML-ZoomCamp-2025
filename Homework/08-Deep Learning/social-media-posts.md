**Subject: Building a CNN from Scratch with PyTorch 🧠**

Excited to share that I've completed Homework 8 of the Machine Learning Zoomcamp by DataTalks.Club! 🎓

In this module, we dove deep into Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using PyTorch to classify different hair types. 🖼️

**Key takeaways:**
✅ Constructing CNN architectures (Conv2d, MaxPool2d, Linear layers).
✅ Implementing binary classification with `BCEWithLogitsLoss`.
✅ Training models on GPU using Google Colab.
✅ Improving model generalization with Data Augmentation (RandomRotation, RandomResizedCrop, RandomHorizontalFlip).

It's amazing to see how powerful these tools are for image classification tasks. Looking forward to the next module! 🚀
