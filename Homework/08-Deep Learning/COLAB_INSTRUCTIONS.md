# How to Run on Google Colab

Since you want to use Google Colab to run the homework (which provides free GPU access), follow these steps:

1. **Open Google Colab**
    * Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Upload the Notebook**
    * Click on **File** > **Upload notebook**.
    * Select the `08-Deep Learning.ipynb` file from your computer (you will need to download it from here first if you haven't already).

3. **Enable GPU (Optional but Recommended)**
    * Go to **Runtime** > **Change runtime type**.
    * Select **T4 GPU** (or any available GPU) under "Hardware accelerator".
    * Click **Save**.

4. **Run the Notebook**
    * I have updated the notebook to automatically download and unzip the dataset (`data.zip`) in the first few cells.
    * Simply run the cells one by one (Shift + Enter) or go to **Runtime** > **Run all**.

5. **Get Answers**
    * The notebook will print the answers for Questions 3, 4, 5, and 6 at the end of the execution.
