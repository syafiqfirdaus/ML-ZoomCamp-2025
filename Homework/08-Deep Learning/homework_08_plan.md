# Homework 8 Completion Plan

## Objective

Complete Homework 8 for ML Zoomcamp 2025 by building a CNN model for hair type classification using PyTorch, and answering the questions in `homework-08.md`.

## Steps

1. **Data Preparation**
    - [x] Download the dataset (`data.zip`). (In progress)
    - [ ] Unzip the dataset. (Will happen automatically after download in the chained command, but I need to verify).
    - [ ] Verify directory structure (`train` and `test` folders).

2. **Notebook Creation**
    - [ ] Create `homework-08.ipynb`.
    - [ ] Import necessary libraries (PyTorch, torchvision, etc.).
    - [ ] Set up reproducibility (seeds).
    - [ ] Define the CNN model architecture as specified.

3. **Answering Questions**
    - [ ] **Question 1**: Identify the loss function.
    - [ ] **Question 2**: Calculate the total number of parameters.
    - [ ] **Training (Part 1)**:
        - [ ] Set up data loaders with specified transformations.
        - [ ] Train the model for 10 epochs.
        - [ ] **Question 3**: Calculate the median of training accuracy.
        - [ ] **Question 4**: Calculate the standard deviation of training loss.
    - [ ] **Training (Part 2 - Augmentation)**:
        - [ ] Add data augmentations.
        - [ ] Continue training for 10 more epochs.
        - [ ] **Question 5**: Calculate mean of test loss for the augmented model.
        - [ ] **Question 6**: Calculate average test accuracy for the last 5 epochs.

4. **Finalization**
    - [ ] Update `homework-08.md` with the selected answers (or provide them clearly).
